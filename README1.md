Once your stream relay is up, there are 2 different links, one of which you are going to need frequently so keep them handy
The RTMP link is the link you will be broadcasting to from OBS or other compatible streaming software
THE RTSP Link is the link you will need to put into what you are trying to view from (TV)

There will be a /RANDOM string you will need to change. Make sure it is unique!
The /Random string you choose will need to match between the RTMP, and RTSP links
