There are a few important steps in order to get you started.

1. Go to the network Tab; Create a new allocation (Big blue button on the bottom right)
2. Copy the newly created secondary port; Go to Startup Tab; Paste inside the RTMP Variable (Replacing the default 9999).
3. Run the server once. If you haven't completed setup, do not worry the server will fail to start, but will regain files.
4. Create a support ticket with us for setup completion and service activation: https://discord.midnighthostingsolutions.com

Once your stream relay is up, there are 2 different links, one of which you are going to need frequently, so keep them handy.
The RTMP link is the link you will be broadcasting to from OBS or other compatible streaming software.
THE RTSP Link is the link you will need to put into what you are trying to view from (TV)

There will be a /RANDOM string you will need to change. Make sure it is unique!
The random string you choose will need to match between the RTMP and RTSP links.

**IMPORTANT** Please complete the above steps 1-3 in their entirety before copying & posting these links **IMPORTANT**
