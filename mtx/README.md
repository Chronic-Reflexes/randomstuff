There are a few important steps in order to get you started.

1. Go to the network Tab; Create a new allocation (Big blue button on the bottom right)
2. Copy the newly created secondary port; Go to Startup Tab; Paste inside the RTMPS Variable (Replacing the default 9999).
3. Create a unique Stream Name inside the Startup Tab (used in connection URL)
4. Create a unique Username & Password inside the Startup tab (So one one hijacks your stream; random password generator suggested)
5. Run the server once. If you haven't completed step 5 the server will fail to start, but will regenerate files.
6. Create a support ticket with us for setup completion and service activation: https://discord.midnighthostingsolutions.com

Once your relay is up and running, there are 2 links, one of which you are going to need frequently, so keep them handy.
The RTMPS link is the link you will be broadcasting to from OBS or other compatible streaming software.
THE RTSP Link is the link you will need to put into what you are trying to view from (TV) (frequent)
